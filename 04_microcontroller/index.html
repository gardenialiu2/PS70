<h3>week 4: microcontroller programming</h3>

<p>i decided to program a servo motor, similar to how we did in class. i had issues with connections, but 
  i was able to debug it by changing to a different ESP32. after getting the servo code to work, i designed and 
  laser cut 2 half-flowers, which i then connected to the servo motor. i decided to use a similar scoring technique 
  as in week 3 to make the flower petals curve. i added a long stem with a cutout so that the servo motor could 
  connect to the flower. when the servo motor spins, the flower does too.

<p>my code is shown below:</p>
<div class="code-block">#include &lt;ESP32Servo.h&gt;

Servo myservo;  // create servo object to control a servo

int pos = 0;    // variable to store the servo position

void setup() {
  myservo.attach(18);  // attaches the servo on pin 9 to the servo object
}

void loop() {
  for (pos = 0; pos &lt;= 180; pos += 1) { // goes from 0 degrees to 180 degrees
    // in steps of 1 degree
    myservo.write(pos);              // tell servo to go to position in variable 'pos'
    delay(15);                       // waits 15ms for the servo to reach the position
  }
  myservo.write(0);                    // send the servo back to 0
  delay(1000);                        // give it enough time to make it there
}
</div>

<p>
  i'm thinking that for my final project, i could incorporate spinning flowers like this onto the dress. 
  it would be interesting to have flowers spinning in different directions on the dress and program them in a way 
  so that they spin at different times and create some sort of optical illusion / wave-like effect. i think this
  project was a good start. i still have to think about if i would want to use servo motors in the flower or some other
  type of motor that allows a full rotation.

<h4>reflection</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    i had issues with connections => debugged by changing to a different ESP32
  </li>
  <li>
    thinking about how i could program many of these flowers for my final project... would they all connect to the same ESP32? 
  </li>
  <li>
    servo motors vs other motors?
  </li>
</ul>
