<h3>week 3: hand tools and fabrication</h3>

<h4>final kinetic sculpture (spinning waterlily)</h4>


<h4>process</h4>
<p>i went through many phases of brainstorming for this before i finally decided on this current iteration.
for this final sculpture, i modeled it after a flower windmill, where spinning would create an optical 
illusion that the flower was full.</p>
<div class="center-row">
  <img src="inspo1.jpg" alt="inspiration for the kinetic sculpture" style="width:60%; margin:20px 0;">

</div>


<p>this sculpture has a few main parts: the platform that the motor sits on, the rod that the motor connects to, 
and the petals of the flower. i decided to keep the base pretty simple. i cut out a box that fits the motor
and added additional pieces to make it look like the lily pad and leaves of a waterlily. for the motor and rod connection,
i opted for a triangular stand that would fold up around the rod. as for the flower, i made cut out thin petals
and a pistil to fit around the rod.</p>

<p>
the base is just a box that fits the protruding parts of the motor. this box is attached to a lilypad cutout. 
then, i used a triangular structure with 3 pieces that fold upwards to secure the rod to the motor. the 
petals of the flower have a hole cut out in the center so that the rod can fit through. these petal pieces are 
scored to create a curved shape.

<p>i was able to reuse some previous designs (later on this page) for connecting to the motor.</p>

<h4>final result</h4>
<p>here is the final kinetic sculpture in action. the flower petals spin around the central axis, creating an optical illusion of a full flower in bloom.</p>

<h4>previous idea</h4>
<p>i wanted to create a flower that could open and close. i began by sketching out some ideas for the flower 
shape and how it should move. my brainstorming is shown below:</p>

<div class="center-row">
  <img src="inspo2.jpg" alt="inspiration for the kinetic sculpture" style="width:60%; margin:20px 0;">
</div>

<p>then, i designed the component in fusion 360 to be laser cut. i wanted a simple shape to latch onto the 
spinning part of the motor, so i measured the dimensions of the shape and put that in fusion 360. since
i was unsure how the cardboard kerf would affect the final dimensions and i needed the cutout to fit
very tightly, i laser cut a couple prototypes to check the dimensions.</p>


<p>i also started out with 3mm cardboard but soon i realized that the laser would burn through part of the cardboard hole and the cardboard
was too flimsy, so i opted for 6mm cardboard instead.</p>

<p>once i had some prototypes, i played around with how the petal should move. i decided to use a thin wire
to connect the petal to the spinning part of the motor. i then added a cutout in the base of the petal's stem
so that the wire could fit through.</p>

<p>i eventually also cut out multiple metals to create the flower, where the goal was to have 2 petals 
be connected to the motor and move back and forth. by positioning these petals over the other petals, i hoped
that the other petals would also move back and forth, simulating how the whole flower would open and close.
however, i ran into some issues with the cardboard being too sturdy for the wire to move it, as shown in the 
video on the right.</p>

<h4>learnings & challenges</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    the motor had many different protruding parts => print multiple iterations
  </li>
  <li>
    kerf affected the final dimensions => measure multiple times
  </li>
  <li>
    3mm cardboard was too thin + laser burned through => use 6mm cardboard
  </li>
</ul>
