<h3>week 3: hand tools and fabrication</h3>

<h4>final kinetic sculpture (blooming flower)</h4>
<h4>process</h4>
i began by sketching out some ideas for the flower shape and how it should move.
i took inspiration from this video of a swing. based off this, it seemed like a similar
mechanism could allow the flower petal to move back and forth. i went through a couple iterations, 
shown below. 
<br></br>
then, i designed the component in fusion 360 to be laser cut. i wanted a simple shape to latch onto the 
spinning part of the motor, so i measured the dimensions of the shape and put that in fusion 360. since
i was unsure how the cardboard kerf would affect the final dimensions and i needed the cutout to fit
very tightly, i laser cut a couple prototypes to check the dimensions. i also started out with TODO mm 
cardboard. i realized that the laser would burn through part of the cardboard hole and the cardboard
was too flimsy, so i opted for 6mm cardboard instead. 
<br></br>
once i had some prototypes, i played around with how the petal should move. i decided to use a thin wire
to connect the petal to the spinning part of the motor. i then added a cutout in the base of the petal's stem
so that the wire could fit through.
, but eventually opted for 6mm for more structure.
