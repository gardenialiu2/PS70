<h3>week 1: final project proposal</h3>

<p class = "margin"></p>
i have 2 ideas for my final project:
<p class = "margin"></p>

<h4>idea 1 : blooming flower dress </h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

i really enjoy fashion and outfits, and i would love to design and create a 
clothing garment that i could actually wear. i recently discovered designer 
cameron hughes’s futuristic dresses, and i find his work really inspiring. i 
want to create a similar kind of wearable clothing item that combines elegance, 
movement, and technology.

<br>
here is some of his work: 
https://www.vogue.com/article/cameron-hughes-tiktok-designer-futuristic 

<br>

the garment i’m imagining would be inspired by a flower. the skirt would be 
made up of petal-like panels that open and close, mimicking the natural blooming
of a flower. possible flower inspirations could include gardenias, orchids, or 
lilies, since since those are my favorite flowers! they also have separated petals
that would translate well into a mechanical garment.

<br>
<br>

i'm thinking the fabric could either be 3D printed or sewn somehow or be built from 
wire and vacuum-suctioned materials. for the electronic component, i would probably use 
some sort of motor to control the opening and closing of each petal. i would program the petals 
to open and close at the same time, so that it looks like the dress is blooming. i'm not sure 
how this movement could be triggered, but i was thinking of using a button or a sensor. 

<br>
<br>

a stretch goal would be to also incorporate lights into the outfit. these lights could turn on 
when the dress begins to open, which would make it look like the dress is glowing while blooming.

<br>
<br>
below, i've included some inspiration sketches and photos.

<h4>idea 2: matcha maker</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

i love matcha, and i think it would be cool to create a device that could make matcha for me. 
the machine would have some 3D stand that holds a bowl and a handle to hold the whisk. for the 
whisking motion, a motor could be used to rotate the whisk at a constant speed and in a "W" motion
to froth up the matcha. a timer or potentially computer vision could detect when the whisking is 
complete, and the machine could stop the motor. i would need to program the timing and speed of the 
whisking motion, as well as the detection of when the whisking is complete. 

<br>
<br>
a difficulty with this is that it may be too difficult for the machine to carry out the whole matcha 
making process and may only be able to handle the whisking part, when the matcha powder and water
is already added to the bowl. if this is the case, i don't think this idea is that appealing compared
to my first idea.
