<h3>week 5: 3D Design & Printing</h3>

<h4>assignment: model and 3D print something</h4>

<div class="center-row">
  <img src="all_fabric.png" alt="All fabric samples" style="width:70%; margin:20px 0;">
</div>
<p class="caption">different infill patterns</p>

<p>i decided to take this week to figure out wheat infill pattern i want for the 3d printed fabric
portion of my dress. for this initial print, i wasn't able to use the more flexible 3d printer filament, 
so my tests were only done with PLA filament. some of my initial prints were too thin which made 
it hard for the printer to completely print the pattern successfully. however, after changing the thickness
i got a couple successful prints. the infill patterns i tried were rectilinear, stars, and hilbert curve.

<br>
out of these, i like the stars the best. i really liked the hilbert curve pattern, but the infill wasn't 
fully connected so it wouldn't have made good fabric.

</div>
<p class="margin">   </p>

<p>out of these i liked the stars pattern the best, but i will continue playing around with the different 
infill patterns to see which one i like the most when flexible filament is used.</p>

<h4>3D scanning</h4>
<p>i also experimented with 3D scanning using the revopoint scanner. i scanned my face but wasn't able to capture my hair.</p>
